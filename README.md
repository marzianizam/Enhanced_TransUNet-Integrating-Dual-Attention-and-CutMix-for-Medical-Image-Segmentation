# Enhanced TransUNet : Integrating Dual-Attention-and-CutMix for Medical Image Segmentation

This repository is part of a final project for the "Deep Learning for Advanced Computer Vision 224C" course at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It reproduces and enhances the TransUNet model, as detailed in the paper ["TransUNet: Transformers Make Strong Encoders for Medical Image Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04306). The project's initial phase involved training a baseline TransUNet model, followed by targeted modifications to improve its segmentation performance.

# Environment

Please prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then use the command (following the original TransUnet repo)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can view our environment specification here.

# Data

The experiments were conducted on the Synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset. Please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet/blob/main/datasets/README.md) for the data preparation.
